  AudioGraph is a platform that links together different artist similarity models that are based on
  <a href="https://acousticbrainz.org">AcousticBrainz</a> audio features. The similarity models have been precalculated in two steps.
  First, automated categorisation of musical recordings is generated by applying hierarchical density-based clustering to aggregated audio features.
  The clustering can then be summed up to artist level to create weighted bipartite artist-cluster networks.
  <br><br>
  For each artist of 18330 in the dataset, four similarity measures in four feature categories have been
  calculated.
  <br>
  The four feature categories are:
  <ul>
    <li>Timbre: MFCC (13 mean + 13 standard deviation) </li>
    <li>Chords: 24 chord histograms </li>
    <li>Tempo: beats per second and onset rate </li>
    <li>Audio: all the above combined</li>
  </ul>
  The similarity measures included are (category name in the interface):
  <ul>
    <li>Global rank (Rank): common categories between artists </li>
    <li>Heat spreading (Heat): common categories weighted by connected artist weights </li>
    <li>Probabilistic spreading (Inference): also known as Network Based Inference </li>
    <li>Maximum Degree Weighted (Maximum): weighted by maximum of the degrees  </li>
  </ul>
