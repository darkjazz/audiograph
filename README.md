## AudioGraph

AudioGraph is an experimental music search platform that links together different artist similarity models that are based on [AcousticBrainz](http://acousticbrainz.org) audio features. The similarity models have been precalculated in two steps. First, automated categorisation of musical recordings is generated by applying hierarchical density-based clustering to aggregated audio features.The clustering can then be summed up to artist level to create weighted bipartite artist-cluster networks.

## Components

AudioGraph front-end is developed in [Angular2](https://angular.io), while the data server is implemented in [Express](https://expressjs.com).

## Running AudioGraph

In order to start the Angular app serving on localhost:4200, install angular-cli, navigate in command line terminal to the project root directory and type:
```
ng serve
```

The server component can be cloned from https://github.com/darkjazz/audiograph-server
